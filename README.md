This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  failure to handle invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with robust error handling.  The error occurs when a non-numeric user ID is passed to the route, resulting in a server-side error. The solution adds validation and appropriate error responses for a more resilient API.
